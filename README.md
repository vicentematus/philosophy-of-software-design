# A Philosophy of Software Design

Interactive companion to John Ousterhout's book [A Philosophy of Software Design talk](https://youtu.be/bmSAYlu0NcY).

## Thought process

How can we use markdown to make talks more interactive? MDX looks great for this.

React offers excellent support for Markdown processing. In contrast, frameworks like Svelte with [mdsvex](https://svelte.dev/docs/cli/mdsvex) have limitations when it comes to using custom components and rendering markdown elements.
