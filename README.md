## Thought process

I highly recommend this book. It's one of those that changes your perspective on programming.

How can we use markdown to make talks more interactive? MDX looks great for this.

React offers excellent support for Markdown processing. In contrast, frameworks like Svelte with [mdsvex](https://svelte.dev/docs/cli/mdsvex) have limitations when it comes to using custom components and rendering markdown elements.

Support John's work by purchasing the book available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1732102201).
