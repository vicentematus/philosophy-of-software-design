## Thought process

I highly recommend this book. It's one of those that changes your perspective on programming.

How can we use Markdown to make long form content more interactive? [^1]

After experimenting with Svelte + [mdsvex](https://svelte.dev/docs/cli/mdsvex) in the [Stacked Tabs repository](https://github.com/vicentematus/stacked-tabs-andy-matuschak) for custom markdown rendering, I found that the ecosystem has limitations, including a lack of customization for rendering markdown elements (`h1`, `h2`, `p`).

In contrast to React + MDX which it's the right tool for the job.
